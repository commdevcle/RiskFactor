<h2>11.01.00 Introduction</h2>
<p>The City of Cleveland’s responsibilities for the day-to-day
management of entitlement program funding are outline in federal and
state regulations, City of Cleveland Code of Ordinances, HUD Memorandums
and this Department Manual. In total, these require that entitlement
funds be used only for eligible activities and expenses. While the City
of Cleveland delegates some responsibility to subrecipients for
day-to-day implementation of federally funded programs, the City of
Cleveland’s Department of Community Development is responsible to HUD
that all program funds and activities meet federal, state and local
rules, regulations, statutes and guideline requirements.</p>
<p>The Department must ensure grantees comply with all regulations
governing administrative, financial and programmatic operations, and
achieve performance objectives on time and within budget. Monitoring
allows the Department to verify compliance with both regulatory and
performance requirements.</p>
<p>The Department of Community Development identifies training needs by
analyzing monitoring data. To increase subrecipient management capacity
and provide relevant technical assistance, training will be targeted to
address the most common challenges revealed in monitorings.</p>
<p>This chapter summarizes the process of program monitoring. It also
gives subrecipients an outline to better understand the program and its
objectives, and offer methods to improve program implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>11.02.00 Overview</h2>
<p>HUD describes monitoring should assess the quality of performance
over time and ensure that findings of audits and other reviews are
promptly resolved.</p>
<p>Through monitoring, the Department of Community Development assesses
a subrecipient’s program compliance and performance over time.
Monitoring provides critical statistical information for making informed
judgments about subrecipients’ management efficiency and program
effectiveness. Monitoring is also helpful in identifying fraud, waste
and abuse.</p>
<p>The Department of Community Development acknowledges its
responsibilities to HUD to ensure all Entitlement funds are used in
accordance with federal regulations. It is the Department’s goal to help
subrecipients comply with these federal regulations, as well as all
state statutes, local ordinances and requirements, and to help resolve
problems in the implementation of their program activities.</p>
<p>Monitoring is the primary tool that the Department of Community
Development uses to ensure this compliance. Monitoring is also an
opportunity to provide focused, specific technical assistance and
guidance based on evaluation of a subrecipient’s processes and
practices. Whenever possible, deficiencies will be rectified through
discussion, negotiation and technical assistance.</p>
<p>All programs and activities that funded through federal entitlement
funds (including CDBG, HOME, ESG, HOPWA, NSP, ARRA, any HUD-funded
disaster relief initiatives and other HUD-funded programs) will be
monitored by the appropriate Department of Community Development
staff.</p>
<p>The Department of Community Development uses monitoring to accomplish
the following objectives: • Ensure all federal funded activities and
projects are carried out effectively, efficiently and in compliance with
applicable laws, regulations and requirements. • Provide technical
assistance and information to subrecipients to improve performance,
develop and increase capacity, and augment management and technical
skills. • Assure that subrecipients with management responsibilities are
performing monitoring(s) based on regular risk assessments, and taking
appropriate steps to improve compliance and reduce risks identified by
those risk assessments and monitorings. • Assure that compliance roles
and responsibilities are clearly established across the subrecipients
systems and that care is given to delegating substantial authority. •
Assure that subrecipients implement standards of conduct, have written
policies and procedures and internal controls capable of ensuring
compliance and reducing possible ethics concerns with their
organizations. • Assure that individuals responsible for program
compliance and ethics have adequate resources, authority and
competencies to carry out their responsibilities. • Assure that the
subrecipients compliance standards, procedures and expectations are
effectively communicated to employees through education and training
programs, publications and other appropriate means. • Assure that
reasonable steps have been taken to achieve compliance throughout the
subrecipient’s organization through auditing and monitoring systems, as
well as periodic evaluations of program compliance. • Assure that
subrecipients maintain an effective mechanism for employees and agents
to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing,
including mechanisms for anonymous reporting and appropriate safeguards
against retaliation. • Report on effectiveness of compliance to the
appropriate Department of Community Development staff. • Take other
actions, or make other recommendations, as necessary to promote an
ethical organization culture.</p>

<div id="monitoring-procedure-for-field-monitorings"
class="section level2">
<h2>11.03.00 Monitoring Procedure for Field Monitorings</h2>
<p>The monitoring visit should be viewed as an opportunity to build a
sense of partnership and increase the subrecipient’s capacity to deliver
services to the residents, businesses and other interested parties in
Cleveland. Monitorings are opportunities for communications and problem
solving technical assistance between the City of Cleveland Department of
Community Development and its subrecipients.</p>
<div id="written-notification-of-monitoring-visit"
class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.01 Written Notification of Monitoring Visit</h3>
<p>The appropriate City of Cleveland Department of Community Development
staff member (Monitor) will contact the grantee prior to the monitoring
to advise them of the upcoming visit and present the date and times
tentatively scheduled. Prior to the agreed monitoring dates, the Monitor
will send written notification, email or letter, notifying the
subrecipient of the monitoring. Included in the written notification
will be a summary of the program areas to be reviewed at the monitoring
and a copy of the review checklists that will be used to perform the
monitoring. This summary provides the subrecipient an opportunity to
review their files prior to the visit to ensure that complete records
will be available, as required.</p>
</div>
<div id="entrance-conference" class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.02 Entrance Conference</h3>
<p>The monitoring visit will begin with the Monitor conducting an
entrance conference. The meeting should include the subrecipient’s
authorized representative (person that signed contract/agreement),
program staff, fiscal staff and other interested parties that the
Monitor may want included. The Monitor will briefly outline the purpose
of the visit, discuss the activities to be monitored, explain the
process of review, and identify the possible outcomes. The Monitor will
ask the subrecipient to identify contact staff for each activity and/or
general support functions, such as the location of copiers, access
hours, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="monitoring-activities" class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.03 Monitoring Activities</h3>
<p>At a minimum, the Monitor will review the activity with the following
City checklists: 1. Accomplishment Review; 2. Procurement; 3. Visual
Program Monitoring; 4. Records and Public Information; and 5. If
activity is HOME, ESG or HOPWA funded, a HUD Monitoring Checklist that
is applicable to the Activity (e.g. HOME Homebuyer Downpayment
Assistance Projects [Exhibit 7-28], ESG Emergency Shelter [Exhibit
28-5], or HOPWA Housing Planning and Rent Subsidies [Exhibit 10-1]) The
City Monitoring Checklists are a condensed version of HUD Monitoring
Checklists that the Department of Community Development has repurposed
to meet its needs for onsite monitoring. The Monitoring Checklists cover
a variety of topics including, but not limited to:</p>

24 CFR Part 570.201(d) Construction of New Housing 24 CFR Part
570.201(m)</p>
<p>Additional topics specifically related to HOME, ESG and HOPWA
compliance are assessed through the Department of Community
Development’s use of the HUD Monitoring Checklists relative to each
activity’s programming and funding source.</p>
<p>The grantee is required to have all records, files and documentation
available for review during the visit. If the subrecipient engages other
public, agencies, operators or consultants for program implementation,
all records must be available at the subrecipient’s office during the
visit. Failure to have all records readily accessible will result in an
“unresolvable” monitoring finding.</p>
</div>
<div id="exit-conference" class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.04 Exit Conference</h3>
<p>The visit is concluded with an exit conference. Responsible
officials, such as the person who signed the contract/agreement, as
well, as program staff are expected to attend. The Monitor(s) will
identify issues revealed in the monitoring. Monitors will provide
details of the issues identified, explain the impacts of the practices
and provide the associated regulation(s). As with all phases of
monitoring, the information provided in the exit conference is technical
assistance and designed to build capacity and ensure program
compliance.</p>
<p>Issues will not be categorized as a “finding”, “concern” or
“information” during the exit conference. The final monitoring category
and necessary actions will be transmitted to the subrecipient via a
formal Monitoring Report.</p>
</div>
<div id="monitoring-report" class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.05 Monitoring Report</h3>
<p>After the visit, the Monitor will meet with the Compliance Manager
and draft a rough version of the Monitoring Report to identify each
issue as either a Finding or a Concern. The Compliance Manager will then
review the draft Monitoring Report, finalize, and refer the Findings and
Concerns to the applicable Commissioner for corrective action
determinations. The Department of Community Development prefers that
program deficiencies be rectified through constructive discussion,
negotiation and technical assistance. The Monitoring Report will reflect
technical assistance provided on-site during the visit and corrective
actions will be structured to reinforce capacity building.</p>
<p>A “Finding” is an action, or lack of action, in direct violation of a
statutory requirement, regulation or City policy.</p>
<p>A “Concern” is an action or action(s) that could result in a Finding
if not corrected.</p>
<p>Both Findings and Concerns require corrective actions to be submitted
to the Department of Community Development for review and approval. A
Finding may result in the repayment of award funds if the problem is an
ineligible activity or project.</p>
<p>“Information” will be provided as technical assistance to strengthen
the subrecipients program management capacity and usually does not
require corrective action.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of the visit, the subrecipient will receive formal
notification, either through email or letter, of the monitoring results.
The subrecipient will be advised to respond in writing about steps
and/or actions taken to resolve the “Findings” and “Concerns”. In rare
cases, depending on the severity of the issues, a follow-up visit may be
necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="post-monitoring" class="section level3">
<h3>11.03.06 Post Monitoring</h3>
<p>Upon receipt of the required response and corrective actions by
subrecipient, the Monitor will review all items for compliance. If
necessary, the Monitor will contact the subrecipient for revisions or
clarification. Once all items have been satisfactorily addressed the
Monitor will draft and issue a Clearance Letter to the subrecipient, via
email or letter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="actions" class="section level2">
<h2>11.04.00 Actions</h2>
<p>The City of Cleveland Department of Community Development, as a HUD
grantee, must prevent the continuation of program deficiencies
identified; mitigate, to the extent possible, the adverse effects or
consequence of deficiencies identified; and/or prevent a recurrence of
deficiencies identified.</p>
<p>If the subrecipient is uncooperative, does not comply with the
monitoring report requirements or does not act to clear the findings and
concerns, Department of Community Development will consider this a
violation of the Contract/Agreement between the City of Cleveland and
the subrecipient.</p>
<p>Department of Community Development actions may include, but are not
limited to: • Issue a letter of warning that additional action(s) will
be taken if deficiencies are not corrected or are repeated. • Advise the
subrecipient that additional information or assurances will be required
before acceptance of one or more certifications required in future
applications for funds. • Advise the grantee that future funding
applications will be assessed negative points during rating and ranking
due to non-compliance with monitoring clearances. • Suspend or terminate
the expenditure of funds for a deficient activity or grant. • Refrain
from extending any further assistance to the recipient until the grantee
is in full compliance.</p>
</div>
<div id="desktop-monitoring" class="section level2">
<h2>11.05.00 Desktop Monitoring</h2>
<p>In addition to field monitorings, the Department has also enacted a
process to perform remote desktop monitorings. The shortened nature of
the desktop monitoring process allows the Department the ability to
conduct them on the same quarterly schedule as the field monitorings,
but in a higher frequency. The Department estimates the number of
desktop monitorings to be twenty-five (25) annually or approximately
seven (7) per quarter.</p>
<p>Desktop monitorings are selected using the same criteria as field
monitorings, however agencies that the Department has field monitored
within the past three (3) years are not excluded from the selection
process. Once selected, the Compliance and MIS staff assign the desktop
monitorings to monitoring staff in the same fashion as field
monitorings.</p>
<p>Desktop Monitors are not required to notify the agency of a desktop
monitoring. They are only required to monitor an agency using the
Accomplishment Review monitoring sheet, and to perform a rudimentary
performance assessment by looking at the drawdown completion to-date for
the activity. Once completed, the desktop monitor must articulate their
findings in a report and decide if further monitoring is required.</p>
<p>If the desktop monitor requires further monitoring, he or she must
communicate their report and findings to the Agency. The desktop monitor
must allow the agency a thirty (30) day window to show satisfactory
evidence that it has complied with the desktop monitor’s findings. If
the Agency complies, the desktop monitor must issue a notice to the
Agency that reflects their compliance. If the Agency does not comply
with the desktop monitor’s findings, the desktop monitor must move
forward by performing a full field monitoring for the activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="selection-criteria-for-monitor-projects-and-programs"
class="section level2">
<h2>11.05.00 Selection Criteria for Monitor Projects and Programs</h2>
<p>The City of Cleveland Department of Community Development has enacted
a monitoring policy to ensure an annual monitoring of approximately
15-30% of its HUD funded activities. The Department of Community
Development shall select 10 programs from its current year HUD 02 Report
on a quarterly basis for monitoring.</p>
<p>The Department of Community Development shall prioritize higher risk
activities by performing a risk-based analysis before randomly selecting
activities on a quarterly basis for monitoring. This risk-based analysis
shall provide each activity a score that is a combination of the total
funding allocated for the activity, and a percentage of the funds drawn
down by the City for the activity, to date. The Department of Community
Development shall give high risk-based scores to those activities with
high funding and low drawn down percentages, and low risk-based scores
to those activities with low funding and higher drawn down
percentages.</p>
<div id="risk-based-factor-methodology" class="section level3">
<h3>11.05.01 Risk-Based Factor Methodology</h3>
<p>An exact breakdown of the Department of Community Development’s
Risk-Based factor scoring and methodology is as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1 – Awarded Amount: The Amount Awarded to an Activity. To
begin the analysis, the Department of Community Development first
determines the activity’s award amount in comparison to the median award
amount for all activities in the PR-02.</p>
<p>Awarded Risk Factor = Awarded Amount/Median Awarded Amount</p>
<p>The activity is then assigned an award amount risk factor on a scale
from 1 to 10 based on the formula referenced above.</p>
<p>Awarded amount risk category Weights • Award Risk Factor &lt;= 25% 1
• 25% &lt; Award Risk Factor &lt;= 50 % 2 • 50% &lt; Award Risk Factor
&lt;= 75 % 3 • 75% &lt; Award Risk Factor &lt;= 100 % 4 • 100% &lt;
Award Risk Factor &lt;= 150% 5 • 150% &lt; Award Risk Factor &lt;= 200%
6 • 200% &lt; Award Risk Factor &lt;= 400% 7 • 400% &lt; Award Risk
Factor &lt;= 600 % 8 • 600% &lt; Award Risk Factor &lt;= 800 % 9 • Award
Risk Factor &gt; 800% 10</p>
<p>Factor 2 – Performance Risk Factor: The Amount Drawn Down by the
Activity to Date. The award amount risk factor is then combined with a
performance risk factor, which is a ratio of the activity’s percent
drawn down to date from its total award over the average drawn down
percentage of all PR-02 activities.</p>
<p>Performance Risk Factor = Ratio of Drawn Down of total Awarded
Amount/Average drawn down rate of all activities on PR02 Report. From
there the activity is assigned a Performance Risk Factor score based on

<p>Factor 3 – Three Year Exclusion Rule (Field Monitoring Only) The
Department shall exclude agencies from field monitoring if the agency
received filed monitoring within the past three years. Agencies that
were field monitored within the past three years are still eligible for
desk monitoring, which may or may not lead to further field
monitoring.</p>
<p>Final Risk Factor Score: The activity’s final Risk Factor score is
created by combining both the Activity’s Award Amount and Performance
Risk Factors. Finally, the Department of Community Development then
re-organizes the activities in the PR-02 Report and divides all of the
activities into the following three categories based on their Risk
Factor scores: • Low Risk: 1-5 • Medium Risk: 6-10 • High Risk:
11-15</p>
<p>Monitoring Selection and Allocation: The Department of Community
Development utilizes the activities’ Risk Factor scores to prioritize
its 20 annual monitorings (4 by quarter) by dividing the activities
among the three levels of risk classification. The Department of
Community Development distributes 25% of its 20 annual monitorings to
the low risk classification, 25% to the medium risk classification, and
50% to the high-risk classification. This division allows the Department
of Community Development to better leverage its time and provide a
stronger monitoring focus on high-risk activities. The overall
monitoring number of 40 is about 27% of the total projects in the PR02
report.</p>
<p>Each quarter the Compliance Manager shall pull a new Per-02 Report
from IDIS and work with the GIS/MIS staff to create new risk factors
scores and organize the activities by risk factors for classification.
From there, the GIS/MIS staff shall use an algorithm to randomly select
the requisite number of monitorings per each classification and provide
the selected list to the Compliance Manager for staff assignment.</p>
<p>As the quarters progress annually, the GIS/MIS team shall remove
previously monitored activities from the eligible pool to avoid
duplicating monitorings. Additionally, the GIS/MIS staff shall remove
administrative activities from the monitoring pool. If the GIS/MIS
algorithm selects an activity with several subactivities underneath it,
the GIS/MIS and Compliance staff shall work together to make a random
selection of subactivities from that list to monitor.</p>

<h3>11.05.02 Monitor Selection</h3>
<p>Once the GIS/MIS staff has selected the activities for monitoring,
they will provide the Compliance Manager with the list of activities for
the quarter. From there, the Compliance Manager shall identify the
requisite staff to perform the monitorings.</p>
<p>The following positions shall be responsible for the monitoring of
each activity by program: City Wide, Social Service and NDA Contract:
Administration Contract Monitoring Specialists Community Development
Corp.’s: Contract Administration Planners Emergency Solution Grants:
Emergency Solution Grant Manager HOPWA Grants: Budget Manager
Storefront: Storefront Manager Miscellaneous MOU’s: Budget Manager
Housing and Development Office: HDO Project Manager Real Estate and
Public Improvement: RE&amp;PI Project Manager Division of Neighborhood
Services: Compliance Assistant Manager</p>
<p>The designated monitor must deliver a Monitoring Letter with
Findings, Concerns, and Information to the subrecipient within 60 days
of being assigned the monitoring. Commissioners shall establish
deadlines for corrective action and monitor follow up.</p>
